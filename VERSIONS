0.1    2003 April 18 - Kenneth Lavrsen
       First release. Could only read data and would not retry any
       data collecting. Downloaded 11 times.
       
0.2    2003 April 20 - Kenneth Lavrsen
       Added retries so that the program will not just terminate if
       reading fails. It will retry initialisation up to 50 times
       and reading up to 5 times. Downloaded twice.
       
0.3    2003 April 23 - Kenneth Lavrsen
       Added writing feature. Program can now write nibbles and set
       and unset bits. Downloaded twice.
       
0.4    2003 April 24 - Kenneth Lavrsen
       Released to satisfy the huge audience of previous versions ;-)
       Split the sources in two files. One with the library of function
       that communicate with the station and one that handles the input
       parameters and the output. The idea is that the readwrite.c and
       readwrite.h files can easily be used to generate new programs
       that use the data or writes data from and to the station.
       Additionally the program dump2300 was created. Besides being an
       example of how to use readwrite.c as a library it is also a nice
       tool to save a larger memory area to disk. The idea is that you can
       use a file comparison tool to see changes in the memory when wheather
       conditions change or when activating certain features.
       The format is ASCII and readable by humans and includes the
       address.
       
0.5    2003 April 30 - Kenneth Lavrsen
       Small improvements to existing programs open2300 and dump2300.
       readwrite.c has been extended with a new read_safe function which
       does the hard work of retrying while reading. It is also renamed to
       rw2300.
       Three new programs have been added which mainly shows the use of
       the rw2300 library. They are however also quite useful when exploring
       the station and its data.
       dump2300 will write out all the data in a given area to the screen
       and to a file.
       bin2300 does the same as dump2300 but the fileformat is kind of
       binary. Each 4-bit nibble in the station is written as one byte in
       the file. If you use start address 0 the file can be viewed in a
       binary file viewer and the addresses will match 1:1. Output to screen
       is human readable.
       history2300 read out a selected range of the history records as raw
       data to both screen and file.
       log2300 is the most useful new tool. It read all the current data
       from the station and add the information to a log file in plain
       ASCII and human readable format. The idea is that this file can
       be used to pick up data from a perl CGI program or PHP page.
       Added a memory map file with all the known data areas inside the
       station.

0.6    2003 May 02 - Kenneth Lavrsen
       Added fetch2300. This software reads all current values from the
       station incl min/max data and dates and output them in a simple
       format to standard out. The idea is that you can call this program
       from a Perl or PHP page and load the data in an array ready for
       display.
       
0.7    2003 May 08 - Kenneth Lavrsen
       The rw2300 library has been made more rubust. Sometimes the WS2300
       will be too busy to answer the RS232 for up to 2 minutes.
       The retry method is now made so that the retry period increases in steps.
       This means that normally the added delay is zero or very short. Only
       when the station gets very busy will the delay become very long.
       This is to ensure that a program such as log2300 does not time out
       causing you to miss a data set. Worst case a delay of 2 minutes has
       been seen. Usually round a whole hour during the night. Maybe it is
       busy syncing with DCF77 (the longwave 77.5 kHz transmitter in Germany
       that the clock is syncronised to) in the European model.
       Added a PHP page that shows a nice webpage with current weather
       station data. Along with it are some graphics files for tendency and
       forecast. No new features to the other programs.
       
1.0    2004 Jan 11 - Kenneth Lavrsen
       Added wu2300. This is a version of fetch2300 which get the data used at
       Weather Underground (http://www.wunderground.com) and uploads it to
       their servers.
       
1.1    2004 Feb 24 - Kenneth Lavrsen
       Fixed a bug in wu2300.c. A "&" was missing which meant that the rain was
       not reported. Thanks to Randy Miller for fixing and reporting this bug.
       
1.2    2004 Mar 07 - Kenneth Lavrsen
       New features summary:
       - Options now in a config file which enables distributing binaries also.
       - The reading of weather data is made into functions making it much
         easier to make your own programs.
       - The code is being ported to also work under windows (compiling with
         open source compiler - mingw).
       - The 1.2 also includes upload to Citizen Weather.
       - A new data log program which stores data in a MySQL database.
       - Binaries for Windows included in distribution (except for mysql2300).
       Details:
       All tools can be built to Windows .exe files using the open source
       MinGW32 compiler. All tools have been tested on Windows XP only.
       The rw2300 library has been extended with many functions that returns
       weather data directly. This means that you no longer have to decode the
       raw data that you receive from the weather station. In 1.2 all current
       data can be read using functions.
       Randy Miller contributed with a program cw2300 which can upload
       Weather Data to the Citizen Weather Observer Program.
       Matt Woodward contributed with xml2300 - a version of fetch2300 which
       stores current weather data in an XML file.
       Matt Woodward contributed with a windows version of the basic serial bus
       communication setup and closure. This was an important contribution in
       getting this entire package ported to Windows.
       Thomas Grieder contributed with a MySQL version of log2300 which has also
       been rewritten for the new rw2300.
       I wish to thank Randy Miller, Matt Woodward and Thomas Grieder for the
       great work which enabled me to make this 1.2
       
       To-dos for next version
       - Make mysql2300 binary
       - Add functions to reset min/max values in the weather station
       - Make small programs that can be run as cron jobs to reset min/max
       - Add a "wind gust" feature which assumes the max wind data to be reset
         often.
       - Make a version of the weather graphs that uses the MySQL data instead
         of the flat file.
         
1.3    2004 Mar 24 - Kenneth Lavrsen 
       rw2300 has been extended with even more functions
       - abs_pressure for absolute air pressure
       - abs_pressure_minmax        -
       - pressure_correction  is the difference between abs. and rel. pressure
       - read_history_info  returns all the data related to the history data
       - read_history_record  returns all the data stored in one history record
       - light  turn background light on or off
       - write_safe  write data to WS2300 including resets and retries to ensure
                     data is actually written.
       Other rw2300 changes:
       - date now returns 4 digit year
       - improvements in comment headers of many functions (cosmetic)
       - the toolset should now also build and work on FreeBSD.
       fetch2300 changes
       - Changed returned date format to ISO8601 date format. This will break
         some userware but better now than later.
       log2300 changes:
       - Added resolution of certain data; rain to two decimals and pressure to
         3 decimals.
       - Changed returned date format to ISO8601 date format.
       xml2300 changes:
       - Added resolution of certain data; rain to two decimals and pressure to
         3 decimals.
       - Changed returned date format to ISO8601 date format.
       open2300 changes:
       - Fixed nasty bug. the strtol function should have a null terminated
         string as input but got a single byte char. This went wrong in Windows.
       win2300 changes:
       - Added some more value settings for the dcb structure. This probably
         has no impact as they are most likely default any way.
       linux2300 changes:
       - Made the serial initialization much more correct and should also now
         work on Free/OpenBSD.
       - Reset06 now flushes the buffer for garbage that was never read.
       light2300 is a new tool in the package. It can turn the LCD backlight on
         and off. Turning light off make the unit self heat less.
       histlog2300 is a new tool in the package also. It fetch data from the
         iternal history data buffer in the weather station and writes it to
         the a logfile keeping track of which record was written last and then
         adds all the new records.
       interval2300 is a new tool which can set and read the time interval at
         which the weather station saves the history datasets.
       weatherstation.php changes:
       - The data parsing has been made compatible with more decimals in the
         data. For US units one should modify to allow more decimals displayed
         for rain and pressure.
         
1.4    2004 Apr 06 - Kenneth Lavrsen
       rw2300 has been extended again:
       - new reset of min/max values for all measurements and reset of rain
         counters.
       - reporting of errors when write goes wrong.
       - the config structure has been extended with new APRS_SERVER settings
         (contribution by Randy Miller).
       linux2300/windows2300 has been improved:
       - the citizen_weather_send() function has been improved so instead of
         using hardcoded server addresses the servers addresses are now placed
         in the config file (original linux version contributed by Randy
         Miller).
       minmax2300 is a new tool using the new rw2300 reset functions to reset
         min/max for all measurements and resetting rain counters.
         
       Kenneth Lavrsen wishes to thank Randy Miller again for another good
       contribution to the project.
       
1.5    2004 April 14 - Kenneth Lavrsen
       Fixed bug in reading and resetting wind minimum (thanks Randy)
       Updated memory map accordingly.
       
1.6    2004 April 22 - Kenneth Lavrsen
       Fixed bug in resetting rain 24 hours
       (copy/paste error of address)
       
1.7    2004 November 07 - Kenneth Lavrsen
       Fixed a pointer overflow bug in fetch2300 which caused seg faults.
       
1.8    2004 November 13 - Kenneth Lavrsen
       Fixed a missing flag in the serial port setup which would often result
       in open2300 failing with a read_safe() error. The problem was related
       to the serial driver translating 0D (CR) to 0A (LF). This unwanted
       feature is now disabled in the setup of the serial port.
       Martin Husemann submitted a patch that further made the serial
       communication more robust.
       
1.9    2005 February 27 - Kenneth Lavrsen
       rw2300 (and therefore all binaries)
       - Fixed two bugs in the wind_reset() function in rw2300.c (thanks to
       Ed Hanway and Bob Atchley for bug reports).
       - Reverted back to the original code of completely resetting the adtio
       struct to all zeros before setting the values(linux only). This seems
       to give less read_safe errors.
       - Fixed inaccuracy bug. All formulars where a value was devided by 100
       were incorrectly done as integer devision. This cased small errors
       on decimal values. (reported by Ed Hanway)
       - Report error when serial port is locked by other program - Linux only
       (Les Niles)
       - Added Ralf Winkler's multilingual version of weatherstation as a zip
       file in the htdocs directory.
       - Added new tool pgsql2300 (Przemyslaw Sztoch)

1.10   2005 March 05 - Kenneth Lavrsen
       rw2300  (and therefore all binaries)
       - Fixed an interger division error that had been missed in 1.9
       (reported with fix by Andrew Braddick).
       - mysql2300.sql definitions for temperatures did not allow space for
       negative temperatures below -9.9. Added extra decimal space for all
       dimentions that can be negative (reported and fixed by Johan Andersson).
       Existing users that already have an mysql table with data can alter the
       definitions with:
       alter table weather modify temp_out decimal(4,1) not null default 0;
       alter table weather modify temp_in decimal(4,1) not null default 0;
       alter table weather modify dewpoint decimal(4,1) not null default 0;
       alter table weather modify wind_chill decimal(4,1) not null default 0;
       
1.11   2007 July - Kenneth Lavrsen

       http://www.lavrsen.dk/twiki/bin/view/Open2300/BugReport2006x04x17x075310
       - Changed timestamp to one field (EmilianoParasassi
       http://www.lavrsen.dk/twiki/bin/view/Open2300/MysqlPatch
       http://www.lavrsen.dk/twiki/bin/view/Open2300/MysqlPatch2

       To-dos for future version
       - Make mysql2300 binary (help wanted)
       - Make a version of the weather graphs that uses the MySQL data instead
         of the flat file.
       - Change the Windows version so that those compiled for no shell window
         will still print messages if shell window already open.
         Contribution for this welcome. Just a hint by email.
